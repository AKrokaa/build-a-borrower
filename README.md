# Build-A-Borrower

A Picrew-inspired avatar creator where you can build your own **borrower**â€”a tiny, magical helper from the world of **Glimmerveil**. âœ¨

This is my first web project, and Iâ€™m learning as I go! I leaned heavily on ChatGPT to bring it all together, but I'm slowly picking up the pieces myselfâ€”one line of code at a time.

[The website is live if you want to try it out yourself!](https://build-a-borrower.com)
